When I got home, there was a message on the machine because the owner realized that our waitress forgot to charge us for our wine.
to be honest we only had drinks and appetizers downstairs as we were there for a collegues leaving drinks but the staff was very friendly (typical aussies) and the food i did have was pretty darn good.
we all liked the brunch items we had but when we later asked if the chips were supposed to come with the meal, the waitress explained it away by saying sometimes they forget instead of apologizing and offering something extra.
